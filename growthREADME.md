# 📈 Growth of Functions using C and GNUplot

## 📖 Description

This project is a solution to **Question 1** of the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Lab**.

The program computes the values of different mathematical growth functions for various values of **n**, stores the results in a text file (`growth.txt`), and automatically executes a GNUplot script (`growth.gnu`) to visualize the growth of the functions.

## 🎯 Objective

- Evaluate the growth of different mathematical functions.
- Compare their asymptotic growth graphically.
- Understand the behavior of various time complexity functions.

## 📊 Functions Plotted

The program plots the following functions:

- n log₂ n
- 12√n
- 1/n
- n^(log₂ n)
- 100n² + 6n
- n^0.51
- n² − 324
- 50√n
- 2n³
- 3ⁿ
- 2³² × n
- log₂ n
- 
## ⚙️ Requirements

- GCC Compiler (MinGW GCC)
- GNUplot
- Visual Studio Code (Recommended)
- C Standard Library
- `math.h`

## 🚀 Compilation

gcc growth.c -o growth -lm

## ▶️ Execution

### Windows
growth

### Linux

./growth

The program will:

1. Generate `growth.txt`.
2. Execute `growth.gnu`.
3. Display the graph automatically using GNUplot.

## 📈 Graph Details

- **X-axis:** Value of `n`
- **Y-axis:** Function Value
- **Scale:** Logarithmic (Y-axis)

A logarithmic scale is used so that functions with widely different growth rates can be compared on the same graph.
